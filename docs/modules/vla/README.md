# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

This module covers the integration of voice, language, and robotic action systems to create intelligent autonomous behavior. The content focuses on how LLMs, perception systems, and robotics work together in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Overview

The VLA module teaches students and developers how to build systems that:
- Process voice input using OpenAI Whisper
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning and natural language understanding
- Execute robotic actions through ROS 2
- Integrate perception systems for environmental awareness

## Structure

The module is organized into three main chapters:
1. **Voice-to-Action Pipelines**: Speech recognition, Whisper processing, and natural language understanding
2. **LLM Cognitive Planning**: Language-to-action conversion and planning algorithms
3. **Capstone Humanoid Project**: Complete system integration and practical applications

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with natural language processing (helpful but not required)
- Interest in AI and human-robot interaction
